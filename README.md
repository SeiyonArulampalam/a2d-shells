# A2D Shells
## Nearly Automatic Differentiation of Geometric Nonlinear Shell Elements
* Develop scalable geometric nonlinear structural analysis of shell elements with a director method. The director method shell elements are adapted from [TACS](https://github.com/smdogroup/tacs)
* Compatible with CPU and GPU computations for parallel speedup.
* Use the package [A2D](https://github.com/sean-engelstad/a2d) for structured differentiation of the energy, jacobian, and residual evaluations.
